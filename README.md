#  Coffee Sales Dashboard - Excel Project

##  Project Overview

This is my first Data Analytics project using **Microsoft Excel**. The purpose is to demonstrate my ability to:
- Clean raw sales data
- Organize and enrich the dataset
- Build a dynamic and interactive dashboard

 This project is **not focused on analysis**, but rather on showcasing Excel skills for data preparation and dashboard design.

##  About the Data

The dataset simulates coffee sales over time and includes:
- Order date and product ID
- Customer info
- Product details (type, roast, size)
- Quantity and unit price

### Raw Data Challenges:
- Missing columns (Country, Coffee Type, etc.)
- No calculated sales
- Inconsistent formats (dates, sizes, currency)

### Cleaned & Enriched:
- Added Coffee Type (Arabica, Robusta, etc.)
- Added Roast Type, Size, and Loyalty Card info
- Calculated the **Sales = Quantity × Unit Price**
- Standardized formatting for currency and dates

##  Dashboard Features

- **Slicers** for filtering:
  - Roast Type
  - Size
  - Loyalty Card
- **Timeline filter** (months and years)
- **Interactive charts**:
  - Line Chart → Total Sales Over Time
  - Bar Chart → Sales by Country
  - Bar Chart → Top 5 Customers

---

##  Use Case

A simulated coffee distributor wants a quick and visual way to:
- Track monthly sales
- Compare coffee type performance
- Identify top countries and customers
- Filter results based on product features (size, roast, loyalty)
